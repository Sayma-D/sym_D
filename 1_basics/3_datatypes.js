"use strict" // it is used as the newer version of java script.

// alert(3 + 3) node doesn't support the arthmetic operations like addition or minus or so on. the people who use this will write it in html file by binding it they will write it in console by inspecting it. the engine of the java script is hidden in browser.

// the code needs to be readable for e.x - 

// console.log(3 + 3) console.log("sayma") // the error will be shown between them but if u put the semicolon between them them it won't but thats not the solution u have to write the next line to new line so that code can be readable.

console.log(3 
    + 3)

console.log("sayma")

// the results will be shown but it will be better not to use it cuz code needs to readable and clear.

let name = "sayma"
// it is knows as string.

let age = 19
// it is nown as the numbers value. 

let isLoggedIn = true
// it is known as the Boolean. 


// we will know how many of the premitive datatypes we will have:

// 1. number = 2 to the power of 53 means the minimum safe integer is this. 

// 2. bigInt = the bigint is used for the bigger numbers specially in trading or in stock markets or in big websites like raddit or in facebookor so on,  but in js code we won't be using the bigint much.

// 3. string = it is used in single quotes or in double quotes but it will be better to use it in double quotes. 

// 4. boolean = it is used for true or false , if the ans is true then true or false. 

// 5. null = it is standalone value. 

// 6. undefined = it means that  have not written the value the deffrence between null and undefined is that if u r writing the variable n not putting its value then it means node will declare it as undefined but null means if u r putting a null instead of the value it means u r asking the node or server for the empty space for value. 

// 7. symbol = it is used to find the uniqueness of the value. it is also used to find the individual component of the variable.

// 8. object = //


// console.log(typeof "sayma"); it will be shown as the string by the node Js. 
// console.log(typeof age); it will be shown as the number by the node. 
// console.log(typeof null); it will be shown as the object cuz it is the object in Node.
// console.log(typeof undefined); it will be shown as the undefined cuz it is the type in Node.
